<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code that describes plain hardware should be minimal to write. One shouldn't have to 'break out' of the generative environment to write plain hardware code.</li>
<li>It should be easy to write generative code mixed with plain hardware.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="differences"><a class="header" href="#differences">Differences</a></h2>
<h3 id="compile-time"><a class="header" href="#compile-time">Compile Time</a></h3>
<p>Arrays need not be bounded. Integers need not be bounded.</p>
<h3 id="runtime"><a class="header" href="#runtime">Runtime</a></h3>
<p>Arrays that have dynamic indices must have a fixed size.
Integers must be bounded.</p>
<h2 id="multiplexer-inference"><a class="header" href="#multiplexer-inference">Multiplexer inference</a></h2>
<p>There is quite a significant difference between an array access with a constant, and one which should infer a multiplexer, but in both cases the syntax in other languages is exactly the same: <code>my_arr[idx]</code></p>
<p>The constant index should infer to just a wire connection which costs nothing. In this case the different wires that are part of an array don't have any relation to each other in hardware. This allows us to bestow other properties as well. For example constant indices don't conflict with each other if they don't point to the same element. Runtime indices do. Array wires with constant indices don't enforce any latency requirements upon each other. 'dynamically sized' arrays can only be indexed with compile time indices. Etc.</p>
<p>With a runtime index (based on an integer wire in the design) should infer to a multiplexer. And then of course the array wires do have a relation.</p>
<p>An initial thought to distinguish the two was to just check for constant-ness of the array argument, which can be done at flattening time. But that wouldn't make the distinction clear enough.</p>
<p>Proposal: Require <code>mux</code> keyword for any runtime array index which should infer to a multiplexer.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>a[5] = 1</code> constant index write</li>
<li><code>a[mux b] = 1</code> multiplexed write</li>
<li><code>x = a[5]</code> constant index read</li>
<li><code>x = a[mux b]</code> multiplexed index write</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="control-flow"><a class="header" href="#control-flow">Control Flow</a></h1>
<p>While hardware doesn't actually have control flow, it is often useful to have <em>generative</em> control flow for repeating hardware structures.</p>
<h2 id="if"><a class="header" href="#if"><code>if</code></a></h2>
<p>The humble if statement is the most basic form of control flow. It comes in two flavors: generation time, and runtime.</p>
<h3 id="generation-time-if"><a class="header" href="#generation-time-if">Generation time if</a></h3>
<p>If its condition is met, then the code in its block is executed. It can optionally have an <code>else</code> block, which then also allows chaining <code>else if</code> statements.</p>
<h4 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example</a></h4>
<pre><code class="language-verilog">gen int a
gen bool b
if a == 5 {
    // Do the first thing
} else if b {
    // otherwise do something here
} else {
    // etc
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="runtime-if"><a class="header" href="#runtime-if">Runtime if</a></h3>
<p>In practice, the biggest difference between these variants is that the code within both branches of the runtime if is executed regardless of the condition. Only assignments are performed conditionally. This means any assignments within the block will have a combinatorial dependency on the condition wire. To avoid confusion, it is not allowed to assign to generative variables within a runtime if.</p>
<h4 id="example-1"><a class="header" href="#example-1">Example</a></h4>
<pre><code class="language-verilog">module m {
    interface m : int a, bool b -&gt; int c 
    if a == 5 {
        c = 4
    } else if b {
        c = 2
    } else {
        c = 1
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="conditional-bindings"><a class="header" href="#conditional-bindings">Conditional bindings</a></h3>
<p>In hardware design, pretty much all data signals will be coupled with <code>valid</code> signals. Having dedicated syntactic sugar for this is thus valuable to lift some mental load for the hardware designer.</p>
<p>As an example, take the <code>pop</code> interface of a FIFO.</p>
<pre><code class="language-verilog">interface pop : bool do_pop -&gt; bool pop_valid, T data
</code></pre>
<p>This is both an action (setting the <code>do_pop</code> signal), but also may fail (<code>pop_valid</code>). Both control signals can be hidden with this syntactic sugar. Furthermore, the output data of the FIFO is only available when the pop was successful. This adds nice implicit semantics that for example the formal verifier could then check.</p>
<pre><code class="language-verilog">FIFO myFifo
if myFifo.pop() : T data {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which is equivalent to this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-verilog">FIFO myFifo
myFifo.do_pop = true
if myFifo.pop_valid {
    T data = myFifo.data_out
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This syntax can also be used to approximate imperative control flow. We would want something in hardware <em>like</em> the lambda functions in software, but what semantics should they have? As a first approximation, we can have the submodule 'trigger' some of our hardware using this validity logic. In this example we use a submodule that generates an index stream of valid matrix indices, and calls our code with that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-verilog">MatrixIterator mit

state bool start
initial start = true

if start {
    mit.start(40, 40)
    start = false
}

if mit.next() : int x, int y {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, this might be a good syntax alternative for implementing Sum Types. Sum types map weirdly to hardware, as their mere existence may or may not introduce wire dependencies on the variants, depending on how the wires were reused. Instead, we could use these conditional bindings to make a bootleg match:</p>
<pre><code class="language-verilog">if my_instruction.is_jump() : int target_addr {
    ...
}
if my_instruction.is_add() : int reg_a, int reg_b, int reg_target {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="for"><a class="header" href="#for"><code>for</code></a></h2>
<p>The <code>for</code> statement only comes in its generative form. It's used to generate repetitive hardware.</p>
<h4 id="example-2"><a class="header" href="#example-2">Example</a></h4>
<pre><code class="language-verilog">module add_stuff_to_indices {
    interface add_stuff_to_indices : int[10] values -&gt; int[10] added_values 
	int[5] arr
	for int i in 0..10 {
		int t = values[i]
		added_values[i] = t + i

		int tt = arr[i] + values[0]
	}
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="while"><a class="header" href="#while"><code>while</code></a></h2>
<p>Similar to the <code>for</code> loop. Also generation only. <strong>Not yet implemented.</strong></p>
<h2 id="chain-and-first"><a class="header" href="#chain-and-first"><code>chain</code> and <code>first</code></a></h2>
<p>the <code>chain</code> construct is one of SUS' unique features. <strong>Not yet implemented.</strong></p>
<p>Often it is needed to have some kind of priority encoding in hardware. It only fires the first time it is valid.</p>
<p>As a bit of syntactic sugar, the <code>first</code> statement uses a chain to check if it's the first time the condition was valid.</p>
<p>It comes in two variants: standalone <code>first</code> and <code>if first</code>.</p>
<h4 id="examples"><a class="header" href="#examples">Examples</a></h4>
<pre><code class="language-verilog">module first_enabled_bit {
    interface first_enabled_bit : bool[10] values -&gt; bool[10] is_first_bit 
    chain bool found = false
	for int i in 0..10 {
        if values[i] {
            first in found {
                // First i for which values[i]==true
                is_first_bit[i] = true
            } else {
                // values[i]==true but not the first
                is_first_bit[i] = false
            }
        } else {
            // values[i]!=true
            is_first_bit[i] = false
        }
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>With <code>if first</code> we can merge both <code>else</code> blocks.</p>
<pre><code class="language-verilog">module first_enabled_bit {
    interface first_enabled_bit : bool[10] values -&gt; bool[10] is_first_bit 
    chain bool found = false
	for int i in 0..10 {
        if first values[i] in found {
            // First i for which values[i]==true
            is_first_bit[i] = true
        } else {
            // values[i]!=true or not first values[i]==true
            is_first_bit[i] = false
        }
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>Often with uses of <code>first</code> one also wants to have a case where the condition never was valid.</p>
<pre><code class="language-verilog">module first_enabled_bit_index {
    interface first_enabled_bit_index : bool[10] values -&gt; int first_bit, bool all_zero 
    chain bool found = false
	for int i in 0..10 {
		if first values[i] in found {
            first_bit = i
            all_zero = false
        }
	}
    if !found {
        all_zero = true
    }
}

<p>Because Hardware synthesis tools will report timing violations from register to register.
Because temporaries generate unreadable register names, having registers on temporaries would make for incomprehensible timing reports.
By forcing the programmer to only add registers (both <code>state</code> and <code>reg</code>) that are explicitly named, we ensure that timing reports will
always have proper names to point to.</p>

<p>In other words: Why <code>int x = 5</code> instead of <code>let x : int = 5</code>?</p>
<p>There's two reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>In hardware design, the types of wires should always be visible. Especially with SUS' "you-get-what-you-see" philosophy, the type of a variable tells you how many wires it is comprised of. This has real impacts on the considerations designers make when designing hardware.</li>
<li>Hardware types tend to be simple, therefore small, and therefore it's not a huge cost to force the programmer to write them out, always.</li>

<h3 id="why-use-tree-sitter-as-the-compiler-frontend"><a class="header" href="#why-use-tree-sitter-as-the-compiler-frontend">Why use tree-sitter as the compiler frontend?</a></h3>
<p>In fact, several people within the <a href="https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/">tree-sitter</a> ecosystem <a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/discussions/831">advise against using it  as a parser frontend</a>. The arguments given are that while tree-sitter has the fault tolerance one would desire for a compiler frontend, getting information on how to resolve these errors such as an expected token list is not yet implemented. Another argument given is that using TreeCursor is incredibly cumbersome.</p>
<p>I had originally written my own tokenizer, bracket matcher, and parser from scratch, and this got me through most of the major syntax I needed for a basic language.
However, editing the language syntax became cumbersome, and bugs kept sneaking into the parsing phase.
While this allowed me to be very informative in reporting the types of syntax error recovery I explicitly implemented, the slow development cycle, and my certain future inability to implement some of the more tricky parsing situations, such as templates, drove me to seek a prebuilt parsing library.</p>
<p>I tried the mainstream parsing libraries. <a href="https://github.com/rust-bakery/nom">nom</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pest-parser/pest">PEST</a> and <a href="https://github.com/zesterer/chumsky">chumsky</a>. These were often recommended to people seeking parser libraries for programming languages. But as I explored them, I ran into various issues. nom didn't support error recovery, PEST had weird issues in getting its grammar to accept whitespace, and chumsky's approach of encoding the whole grammar within the type system made for ridiculous compile times and impossible to debug typing errors.</p>
<p>A big thing all of these issues stem from is all of these libraries' insistence on a typed syntax tree. While this seems like a good idea, it makes it difficult to properly embed error nodes in the syntax tree. tree-sitter's barebones interface to its untyped syntax tree with error nodes is fine in this case, and it gives tree-sitter the benefit of much simplified memory allocation strategy.</p>
<p>Speaking of performance, tree-sitter's performance is absolutely unmatched. Especially because SUS intends to provide instantaneous feedback to the user, as they write their code, speed is essential. Tree-sitter's incremental updates feature is then icing on the cake.</p>
<p>Of course, dealing with tree-sitter's stateful <code>TreeCursor</code> object to traverse the syntax tree is difficult, especially in a language like Rust that doesn't like mutable objects. I was able to build a nice abstraction, called <code>Cursor</code> that abstracts away the mutable bookkeeping of TreeCursor, and presents a 'monad-like' interface for decending down syntax tree branches easily. It is defined in <a href="https://github.com/pc2/sus-compiler/blob/6bffb4d0987a01e86354e591cd1e9023878601ba/src/parser.rs#L261-L490">parser.rs</a>.</p>

<p>So in software design, the idea of a function is straight-forward. It is a block of code, that receives some input, and then produces some output. The moment the function is called, it is brought into existence, does its task, and then once it completes it and returns the output, ceases to exist again.</p>
<p>In hardware however, modules are persistent. They are continuously receiving inputs, and continuously delivering outputs. Modules may even have multiple interfaces that are in operation simultaneously. This is why in many HDLs modules are instantiated, and then connected to the outside world by explicitly connecting wires to all their ports. Of course many modules people write will be quite 'function-like', and so we want to allow a shorthand notation for this. As an added bonus, 'function-like' modules may be able to be run in compile-time contexts.</p>

<p>Because we have a broader vocabulary describing our modules, it becomes possible to modify instantiations of modules to add functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous (default): The module behaves like a freestanding module, inputs and outputs are expected on each clock pulse</li>
<li>Push: The module only advances when instructed by the parent module. This only affects <code>state</code> registers. Latency is unaffected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additional modifiers</p>
<ul>
<li>Latency-free: All latency registers are removed</li>
<li>Set latency: sets the latency between two connectors (ports, locals, fields etc), adding or removing latency registers as needed. Mustly used to override latency for tight feedback loops.</li>

<p>A module can have one or more interfaces, each of which consists of multiple input and output ports.</p>
<p>Interfaces form the only method by which one can cross latency and clock domains. Each interface has with it its associated hardware, that operates within the same clock and latency counting domain. Wires which belong to the same latency counting group should be placed in the same interface.</p>
<p>The code in one interface can read wires from other interfaces, provided the proper clock domain crossing method is used, in case of a clock domain crossing. Writes however, can naturally only be done by the interface that owns that wire.</p>
<p>To transfer data from one interface to another, use the <code>cross</code> keyword. To ensure that multiple wires stay in sync when needed, you can cross multiple wires together: <code>cross wire_a, wire_b, wire_c</code>. This ensures that any relative latencies are maintained in the target interface. Latencies are not kept in sync for wires in separate <code>cross</code> statements.</p>

<h2 id="theory"><a class="header" href="#theory">Theory</a></h2>
<p>Inserting latency registers on every path that requires them is an incredibly tedious job. Especicially if one has many signals that have to be kept in sync for every latency register added. This is why I propose a terse pipelining notation. Simply add the <code>reg</code> keyword to any critical path and any paths running parallel to it will get latency added to compensate. This is accomplished by adding a 'latency' field to every path. Starting from an arbitrary starting point, all locals connected to it can then get an 'absolute' latency value, where locals dependent on multiple paths take the maximum latency of their source paths. From this we can then recompute the path latencies to be exact latencies, and add the necessary registers.</p>

<p>This is in my opinion a big benefit to making the distinction. When inserting latency registers, we are saying in effect "If we could perform these computations instantaneously, we would", and thus, a loop containing latency registers would still be a combinatorial loop. Sadly, this does break down a little when explicitly building a pipelined loop. Also combinatorial dependencies could show up across interfaces as well. Perhaps we should rethink this feature.</p>
<h3 id="latency-counting-with-state"><a class="header" href="#latency-counting-with-state">Latency counting with state</a></h3>
<p>Of course, state registers are also moved around by latency. This means that while it appears like (and we want the programmer's mental model to say that) two state registers get updated at the same time, they may actually be offset from one another in time.</p>
<p>However, state registers do not count towards the latency count. So specifying <code>reg</code> increases the latency count by 1, but specifying <code>state</code> does not. This makes sense, because state registers are meant to carry data across cycles, whereas latency registers are only meant for meeting timing closure, and don't allow sequential data packets to interact.</p>
<h3 id="maximum-latency-requirements"><a class="header" href="#maximum-latency-requirements">Maximum Latency Requirements</a></h3>
<p>It's the intention of the language to hide fixed-size latency as much as possible, making it easy to create pipelined designs.</p>
<p>Often however, there are limits to how long latency is allowed to be. The most common case is a <code>state</code> to itself feedback loop. If a state register must be updated every cycle, and it depends on itself, the loopback computation path may not include any latency.</p>
<p>For example, a FIFO with an almost_full threshold of <em>N</em>, may have at most a <code>ready_out -&gt; valid_in</code> latency of <em>N</em>.</p>
<p>For state to state paths, this could be relaxed in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it is proven the register won't be read for some cycles, then the latency can be hidden in these cycles. (Requires complex validity checking)</li>
<li>Slow the rate of state updating to the maximum latency, possibly allow automatic C-Slowing.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="breaking-out-of-latency-counting"><a class="header" href="#breaking-out-of-latency-counting">Breaking out of latency counting</a></h4>
<p>Feed-forward pipelines are an important and useful construct. But feed forward pipelines can't describe all hardware. We need to be able to break out of the latency counting system, and tell the latency counting system that there exists a latency differential between two nodes, without instantiating registers between them. In the case of making a dependent latency earlier than the source one, we call this edge a 'negative backedge'. This should be provided as a template module in the standard library:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Verilog">module rebase_latency&lt;T, gen int delta&gt; : T i'0 -&gt; T o'delta {/*...*/}
</code></pre>
<p>As an example, we can have a module with an internal negative backedge of -3, which itself contains some state that the backedge can originate from. The module wraps the backedge this way, and proves all of the safety requirements that come with using it. The user then is free to connect the output of this module combinatorially with the input, and with at most 3 cycles of latency.</p>
<p><img src="/images/negativeBackedgeConcept.png" alt="Negative Backedge Concept" /></p>
<p>As a more concrete example, consider the write side of a FIFO.
<img src="/images/fifoExample.png" alt="FIFO Negative Backedge" /></p>
<h3 id="latency-specification"><a class="header" href="#latency-specification">Latency specification</a></h3>
<p>Specifying latencies on every single input and output is a bit cumbersome, so we wish to infer latencies as much as possible. Sometims however specific constructions with indeterminable latencies require the user to explicitly specify the latencies. We will explore such cases in later chapters.</p>
<p>When the user specifies latencies on multiple nodes, they are in effect stating that they know what the exact latencies between the given nodes are. Theorethically we should include this into the algorithm as extra edges between each pair of nodes <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, of latency <code>lb-la</code> and <code>-(lb-la)</code> backwards. This fixes the latency differential to be as the user specifies it. In practice in the Latency Counting Algorithm, we don't actually do this in this way, but instead handle specified latencies in a dedicated part of the algorithm, to provide the user with more readable error messages. In any case, the latencies assigned by the algorithm should be equivalent to doing it with the extra edges.</p>
<p>If the user provides not a single latency annotation, then we allow the compiler to set an arbitrary node's latency to 0, as a seed for the algorithm. Because input and output nodes have to be fully constrained, the compiler picks one of these if possible.</p>

<ul>
<li>Addition or Removal of any latency registers that do not violate a constraint must not affect the operation of the design.</li>
<li>Feedback loops containing only latency are considered combinatorial feedback loops, and are therefore forbidden. Feedback loops must therefore have at least one state register in them.</li>
<li>When the user specifies a latency of 1 somewhere using the <code>reg</code> keyword, this instructs the compiler that the <em>minimum</em> latency between these points is now 1. The compiler is allowed to insert additional latency registers between any two nodes as it sees fit.</li>
<li>State registers to not impact the latency counting. They count as 0 latency.</li>
<li>Any loop (which must contain at least one state register) must have a roundtrip latency ≤ 0. Negative values are permitted, and are simply attributed to the use of negative back edges.</li>
<li>Specified latencies must be matched exactly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="extra-requirements-to-allow-latency-inference"><a class="header" href="#extra-requirements-to-allow-latency-inference">Extra requirements to allow latency inference</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The latency between input and output nodes that have a combinatorial connection must be <em>minimal</em>. In other words, if an output <code>o'lo</code> is reachable from an input <code>i'li</code> by only following forward dependencies, then <code>|lo|-|li|</code> is exactly the latency of the longest path between them.</li>
<li>Nodes that are not an input or output, don't have a latency specified, and have multiple options for their latency are set to the earliest possible latency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="latency-counting-graph-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#latency-counting-graph-algorithm">Latency Counting Graph Algorithm</a></h2>
<p>We are given a directed graph of all wires and how they combinatorially depend on each other. Each edge can have a number of latency registers placed on it.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Verilog">// timeline is omitted here, not important
module Accumulator {
    interface Accumulator : int term, bool done -&gt; int total_out 
    state int total

    int new_total = total + term

    if done {
        reg total_out = new_total
        total = 0
    } else {
        total = new_total
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Which results in the following graph:
<img src="/images/example.png" alt="Example" /></p>
<p>Nodes are coloured by role. Blue nodes are inputs, green nodes are outputs, orange nodes are state registers, and white nodes are combinatorial.</p>
<p>On the edges are noted the minimum latency offsets in black. These are given. The goal of the algorithm is to compute a set of 'absolute latencies', which are all relative to an arbitrary node. These are given with the red nodes on the picture. Because these absolute latencies are relative to an arbitrary reference point, we accept any constant shift applied to all absolute latencies as equivalent.</p>
<h3 id="non-determinable-inference-of-input-and-output-absolute-latencies"><a class="header" href="#non-determinable-inference-of-input-and-output-absolute-latencies">Non Determinable inference of Input and Output absolute latencies</a></h3>
<p>Sadly, while it appears reasonable to think it's possible to assign a determinable latency. Observe this contrived example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Verilog">module NonDeterminableLatency {
    interface NonDeterminableLatency : int a, int b -&gt; int x, int y 
    reg int a_d = a
    int t = a_d + b
    reg reg reg int a_dd = a
    reg int t_d = t
    x = t_d + a_dd
    y = t
}
</code></pre>
<p>Simplified latency graph:
<img src="/images/nonDeterminable.png" alt="Non Uniquely Determinable Example" /></p>
<p>The issue starts when the inputs and outputs don't have predefined absolute latency. We are tempted to add maximization and minimization to the input and output absolute latencies, to force the module's latency span to be as compact as possible, and therefore maximize how free the user of this module is in using it. But sadly, we cannot make a uniquely determinable latency assignment for our inputs and outputs, as in this example b and y press against each other, permitting two possible implementations.</p>
<p>One may think the solution would simply be to prefer inputs over outputs or something, just to get a unique latency assignment. Just move b to be the earliest of the available latencies, but even in this case, if we instead looked at the possibilities of a, and fixed b, we would again make b later by making a earlier. And since there's no way to distinguish meaningfully between inputs, there's no uniquely determinable solution either.</p>
<p>To this problem I only really see three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Still perform full latency computation when compiling each module separately. In the case of non-determinable latency assignment, reject the code and require the programmer to add explicit latency annotations. The benefit is better encapsulation, the programmer requires only the module itself to know what latencies are. The downside is of course less flexible modules. Though is this flexibility <em>really</em> needed?</li>
<li><del>Infer absolute latencies on the inputs and outputs of submodules using templates which can be inferred. This would be really handy to allow latency information to flow back into the templating system, thus allowing a FIFO that alters its almostFull threshold based on its input latency. Of course, this makes absolute latency information flow from top-down instead of bottom up, so now getting the latency information back from the module would be impossible. The issue is that templates can't be instantiated partially. Either the submodule takes all of its port latencies from the calling module, or it determines its latencies itself</del></li>
<li><del>Perform latency computation at integration level, we don't define the absolute latencies on the ports of a module, unless the programmer explicitly does so. For simlpicity, this requires that every single module instantiation now compiles to its own Verilog module though, which is less than ideal for debugging</del></li>
</ul>
<p>Simply solve the above module by explicitly specifying latencies to the two inputs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-Verilog">module LatencySpecified {
    interface LatencySpecified : int a'0, int b'1 -&gt; int x, int y 
    reg int a_d = a
    int t = a_d + b
    reg reg reg int a_dd = a
    reg int t_d = t
    x = t_d + a_dd
    y = t
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="latency-graph-cycles-are-the-key"><a class="header" href="#latency-graph-cycles-are-the-key">Latency Graph Cycles are the key</a></h3>
<p>So assigning absolute latencies is difficult, and no good solution can be found in isolated cases. Perhaps another approach would work better.</p>
<p>In essense, what are the reasons for which we want to count out latencies? The initial one of course was keeping signals in sync. In the vast majority of cases when you pipeline a design, you don't want to cross signals from different time steps. But of course, after pipelining a design, you need to <em>deal</em> with the effect that this module now takes several cycles, and has a certain capacity to store in progress data.</p>
<p>Maybe instead of trying to infer the latencies from the pipeline with inputs and outputs, we focussed our attention purely on the cycles. These are already nice and constrained.</p>
<h3 id="should-compound-types-latency-be-kept-in-sync"><a class="header" href="#should-compound-types-latency-be-kept-in-sync">Should Compound Types' latency be kept in sync?</a></h3>
<p>Arrays, structs, tuples, etc. Should the absolute latencies of these be kept in sync? On the one hand, it's easier on the programmer if they do stay in sync. It's easier to reason about. A problem is though, that strictly keeping all latencies of an array in sync could introduce unnecessary dependencies, and therefore make the pipeline deeper than it needed to be. Also, if we forcibly keep array and struct elements in sync, then we can't express certain generic construct, such as a latency shift register, or allowing us to pipeline a sequence of similar steps where intermediary results are all stored in the same array.</p>
<p>If you go all the way to the opposite end of the spectrum however, splitting up every struct, every array, and every tuple into their component wires, then the development experience suffers. For Arrays or structs with differing latencies the compiler can't give nice diagnostics. Also from a simulation perspective, simulators know the concepts of arrays and structs. Should SUS outputs only be simulable on a wire-by-wire basis? Or should we keep the structures intact but have internally different latencies? None of these options are really appealing.</p>
<p>Of course, we could mostly mitigate this by re-merging structs and arrays that happen to all have the same latency. But then again, it feels like it would be brittle and cause unexpected errors for the programmer.</p>
<p>In the end, I think that having the programmer explicitly state when to split a latency is best. And we do this with the <code>'split</code> latency specifier. This explicitly splits the underlying wire into separate 'real' wires. This allows the programmer to make the tradeoff, for explicit latency flexibility, and accepting the cost that this structure will be less nice in the resulting verilog.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-sus-standard-library"><a class="header" href="#the-sus-standard-library">The SUS Standard Library</a></h1>
<p>By making cycle-latency mostly transparent to the programmer, we enable the use of more generic building blocks. These should be grouped into a standard library built specifically for the language.</p>
<h2 id="common-interfaces"><a class="header" href="#common-interfaces">Common interfaces</a></h2>

<h2 id="memory-blocks-and-fifos"><a class="header" href="#memory-blocks-and-fifos">Memory blocks and FIFOs</a></h2>
<p>Configurable Memory primitives and FIFOs should certainly be part of the standard library. These are so fundamental to any hardware design, and appear to be uniquitous across FPGA vendors. These Memory primitives should however not be fully fixed. Attributes such as read latency and read-write conflict resolution vary substantially between vendors, so this should be left up to the target platform. However of course it should always be possible to properly fix these values in situations where the programmer needs them. Such as when one needs a 0-cycle memory read, even if that would mean it would reach terrible timing, or not synthesize at all on some platforms.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why I believe the 'inference' doctrine of defining memory blocks is fundamentally flawed. An inference implementation will always make implicit assumptions about the read latency and read-write conflict, meaning the code isn't properly portable across devices.</p>
<h3 id="multi-clock-memories-and-fifos"><a class="header" href="#multi-clock-memories-and-fifos">Multi-Clock Memories and FIFOs</a></h3>
<p>It is still up for debate whether multi-clock variants should be implicit from the use, or explicit different types. There are arguments to be made for both approaches.

<p>One important observation I recently made was on Optimization. I had been quite proud of my unusual stance on "Optimization is a Non-Goal". But as I add more and more abstractions to the language, I come around to a different conclusion. Being a hardware designer in the lowest abstraction layer - Verilog, I believed that hardware itself was fundamentally unoptimizable when written out in this lowest abstraction layer, because any optimization the compiler could do could go against the intention of the programmer, undoing for example place-and-route considerations the programmer had made. As I introduced new abstractions however, I kept bumping into the problem of "what if I don't need this abstraction?".</p>
<p>Making the abstractions always optional seemed to run counter to the safety promises I wanted to make, instead what would we ideal was if the programmer can specify their interface within the bounds of the abstraction, and somehow prove that the compiler will recognise the situation and remove the abstraction's overhead. In essense, this is what it means to do optimization.</p>
<p>This more nuanced view is summarized as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Optimization should be a goal insofar as it is the un-doing of abstractions.</p>
<p>Likewise, abstractions are only permissible if there is some all-encompassing optimization the compiler can perform to undo the abstraction if needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I still believe hardware is still broadly unoptimizeable. In contrast to software design, where the primary optimization target is Speed, in hardware there are multiple targets that are mutually at odds with each other. Clock speed, Cycle latency, logic, memory and DLS utilization, and routing congestion. No 'optimal' HW solution exists, and so it is up to the programmer to make this tradeoff.</p>
<p>This is why I consider HLS to be misguided in their "Just write it as software code and we'll do the optimization for you" approach.</p>

<p>For latency see <a href="latency.html">latency</a></p>
<p>State goes hand-in-hand with the flow descriptors on the ports of modules. Without state all a module could represent is a simple flow-through pipeline.</p>
<p>But once we introduce state, suddenly modules can have a wide range of output patterns and required input patterns. A simple example would be a data packer or unpacker. An unpacker receives a data packet, and outputs its contents in parts over the next N cycles. How should this unpacker behave when it receives another data packet before it finishes? It can either discard what it's currently working on, or discard the incoming data. Either way, data is lost. So the packer's interface must prohibit incoming data for N-1 cycles after a valid packet.</p>
<p>The language we choose for the interfaces is that of the regex. This is a natural choice, since in effect any module the user writes is a state machine, and regexes can be converted to state machines. State machines have a nice property, that operators for working with state machines are polynomial and easy to understand.</p>
<h2 id="structural-and-data-state"><a class="header" href="#structural-and-data-state">Structural and Data State</a></h2>
<p>We have to check the state machine that is each module against the state machines of the modules it uses of course. Sadly, this checking can only really be done in a generic way by generating the full module state machine, and checking its behavior against the state machine from its dependents' interfaces, as well as its own.</p>
<p>Generating the whole state machine is a combinatorial endeavour however, and a too wide state vector quickly leads to an unmanageable number of states. This encourages us to differentiate between two types of state. Structural State (namely state whose instances are incorporated into the module STM), and Data State, which (aside from its validity) is not. We wouldn't care about every possible bitpattern of a floating point number we happened to include in our state right?</p>
<h2 id="examples-3"><a class="header" href="#examples-3">Examples</a></h2>
<h3 id="summing-module"><a class="header" href="#summing-module">Summing module</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-Verilog">timeline (X, false -&gt; /)* .. (X, true -&gt; T)
module Accumulator {
    interface Accumulator : int term, bool done -&gt; int total 
    state int tot := 0 // Initial value, not a real assignment

    int new_tot = tot + term
    if done {
        total = new_tot
        tot = 0
        finish // packet is hereby finished. 
    } else {
        tot = new_tot
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case the compiler would generate a state machine with two states. One state for when the module is active, and one is generated implicitly for the inactive case. The regex is mapped to a 3-state state machine. Represented below:</p>
<ul>
<li>A: <code>inactive</code></li>
<li>B: <code>(X, false - /)</code></li>
<li>C: <code>(X, true - T)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The regex produces the following NFA: (-&gt; is a consuming transition, =&gt; is not)</p>
<ul>
<li>A -&gt; A when !valid</li>
<li>A =&gt; B when valid</li>
<li>B -&gt; B when !done</li>
<li>B =&gt; C when done</li>
<li>C -&gt; A</li>
</ul>
<p>Compiled to a DFA this gives:</p>
<ul>
<li>A -&gt; A when !valid</li>
<li>A -&gt; B when valid &amp; !done</li>
<li>A -&gt; C when valid &amp; done</li>
<li>B -&gt; B when !done</li>
<li>B -&gt; C when done</li>
<li>C -&gt; A when !valid</li>
<li>C -&gt; B when valid &amp; !done</li>
<li>C -&gt; C when valid &amp; done</li>
</ul>
<p>The code's state machine must be proven equivalent to the regex state machine. This is done by simulating the code STM based on the regex. The code must properly request inputs at regex states where inputs are provided, and may not when not. It's inputs must be valid for <em>any</em> path in the regex STM, while it's outputs must conform to <em>some</em> path of the regex.</p>
<p>Any module working on finite packet sizes must also specify the <code>finish</code> keyword when the module is finished sending a packet.
At this point the initial conditions must be reestablished explicitly. After this, the module goes back into the inactive state.</p>
<p>In this example, the code simulation starts right in its initial state. Then the different paths of the regex STM are all simulated. For the case of infinite loops, we save any distinct (regex, code-STM) pair we come across, and skip combinations we've already come across.</p>
<p>Since in this example the only active state for the code corresponds to both active states of the regex, the code must abide by the constraints of both regex paths. And it does, in the case <code>done == false</code> the module may not output <code>total</code> Likewise, in the case <code>done == true</code>, the module <em>must</em> output <code>total</code>. And in the case of <code>done == true</code>, the code has to go back to the initial state through the <code>finish</code> keyword.</p>
<p>The caller is then responsible for providing a stream of the form of the regex.</p>
<h2 id="unpacker"><a class="header" href="#unpacker">Unpacker</a></h2>
<p>The previous example was quite simple though, with the code's active state machine containing only one state. In this example we explore a module that does have structural state.</p>
<pre><code class="language-Verilog">timeline (X -&gt; X) .. (/ -&gt; X) .. (/ -&gt; X) .. (/ -&gt; X)
module Unpack4&lt;T&gt; {
    interface Unpack4 : T[4] packed -&gt; T out_stream 
    state int st := 0 // Initial value, not a real assignment
    state T[3] stored_packed

    if st == 0 {
        out_stream = packed[0]
        stored_packed[0] = packed[1] // Shorthand notation is possible here "stored_packed[0:2] = packed[1:3]"
        stored_packed[1] = packed[2]
        stored_packed[2] = packed[3]
        st = 1
    } else if st == 1 {
        out_stream = stored_packed[0]
        st = 2
    } else if st == 2 {
        out_stream = stored_packed[1]
        st = 3
    } else if st == 3 {
        out_stream = stored_packed[2]
        st = 0
        finish // packet is hereby finished. 
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the regex has 4 states, but we don't know what number of states the code has. One could bound the integer <code>st</code> of course, and for the number of states multiply together the counts of all structural state objects we find. But we don't need to. We can simply simulate the code, only explicitly saving the structural state fields.</p>
<p>In this case, we know the starting value of <code>st</code>, and we just need to simulate the hardware with this. So in the first cycle, we are obligated to read from <code>packed</code>, and write to <code>out_stream</code>. Following the code that is the case, as we execute the first branch: <code>st == 0</code>. We know the next state <code>st = 1</code>, so we continue going along. This continues for the remaining states of the regex, ending at <code>st == 3</code> where we also call <code>finish</code>.</p>

<h2 id="state-vs-latency"><a class="header" href="#state-vs-latency">State vs Latency</a></h2>
<p>In my experience, the use of registers usually boils down to two use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Representing a current working state, which gets updated across clock cycles</li>
<li>Improving timing closure by introducing registers on tight paths.</li>
</ul>
<p>While this distinction exists in the programmer's mind, it isn't in the vocabulary of common compilers. Verilog and VHDL just call both 'reg' (And non-registers too, but that's another can of worms.)</p>
<p>Philosophically, the difference is quite important though. Registers that are part of the state are critical, and they directly direct the functioning of the device. While latency registers should not affect the functioning of the design at all, aside from trivially affecting the latency of the whole design. Some would argue that worrying about latency registers is a solved problem, with retiming tools that can automatically migrate latency registers across a design to place them wherever more timing slack is required. In practice though, this capability is limited, usually by explicitly marking specific paths as latency insensitive, or in a limited way by synthesizing a block of registers somewhere, which should then be migrated across the design. Still, this practice is always limited by the first design register it comes across along the path. Explicitly differentiating between state and latency registers could make this automatic retiming much more powerful.</p>
<p>While indeed generally latency can't affect the actual operation of the device, it can be disallowed in certain circumstances. Certain paths are latency sensitive, and would no longer produce correct results if latency were introduced. A trivial example is any kind of feedback loop. In this case, no latency can be introduced within the feedback loop itself, as the result for the current feedback loop cycle wouldn't arrive in time. In this case the latency should either be forbidden, or reincorporated in a different way, such as interpreting the state loop as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-slowing">C-Slowed</a> state loop.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-trouble-with-parsing-templates"><a class="header" href="#the-trouble-with-parsing-templates">The Trouble with Parsing Templates</a></h1>
<p>Templates in the modern style of C++ or Java are incredibly hard to parse, and seemingly manage to conflict with just about every other syntax in common use.
They can occur in many circumstances. Most commonly in types, but also in function calls and constants.
Their ubiquity compounds the issues described below.</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">void myFunc() {
  vector&lt;int&gt; myVec;
}
</code></pre>
<p>All languages that choose to adopt this standard employ limitations around their use. In Java it's not possible to pass values as template arguments, in C++ often the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/610245/where-and-why-do-i-have-to-put-the-template-and-typename-keywords"><code>template</code> keyword must be inserted for the parser to understand</a>.</p>
<p>Take the fully ambiguous case of this function call:</p>
<pre><code>myFunc&lt;beep&gt;(3)
</code></pre>
<p>This can be parsed in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way we as the programmer intend, IE it to be a template instantiation</li>
<li>Two comparison operators with a value between parentheses: <code>(myfunc&lt;beep) &gt; (3)</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a proper grammatical ambiguity.</p>
<h2 id="template-troubles-for-sus"><a class="header" href="#template-troubles-for-sus">Template troubles for SUS</a></h2>
<p>In SUS there's quite a few things that come together that make this notation of templates difficult. For starters, SUS also has the <code>&lt;</code> <code>&gt;</code> comparison operators, which provides an immediate conflict, just like in the above example.</p>
<p>Another less well known conflict from this notation comes from the commas. Take calling:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">myFunc(choice&lt;3, 6&gt;(5), x, y, z);
</code></pre>
<p>If the parser interprets the <code>&lt;</code> as a comparison, then the commas separate function arguments, but if it were to interpret them as a template then the first comma separates template arguments.</p>
<p>What's more, SUS has a few extra notations that also conflict with this idea, namely multiple value declarations, which are used for functions that return multiple values.</p>
<p>To illustrate:</p>
<pre><code class="language-cpp">int b;
int[5] c;
int a, b, c[0], myType&lt;int, bool&gt; d = myFuncReturningFourResults();
</code></pre>
<p>Where the intent is to assign to a newly declared <code>a</code>, an existing variable <code>b</code>, indexing into array <code>c</code>, and a new variable <code>d</code>.</p>
<p>This notation combines declarations with assignable expressions.
The issue is that if the compiler can accept both declarations and arbitrary expressions, then there's two perfectly valid parses for <code>d</code>. Either the one we intend, or it becomes two expressions <code>myType&lt;int</code> and <code>bool&gt; d</code>.
While it may seem a bit dumb to assign to the output of a comparison operator to the parser it's all <code>_expression</code>.</p>
<h2 id="solutions"><a class="header" href="#solutions">Solutions</a></h2>
<p>There's two solution archetypes I see: The Rust solution, and the Verilog solution. I've chosen a mix of the two.</p>
<h3 id="rust"><a class="header" href="#rust">Rust</a></h3>
<p>In so-called "type contexts", where the only this that's allowed to be written is a type, types are simple: <code>Option&lt;i32&gt;</code>, <code>Result&lt;Vec&lt;i32&gt;, String&gt;</code>, etc.
Rust solves it with adding <code>::&lt;</code> in cases where it would otherwise be a parsing ambiguity, like <code>my_func::&lt;3&gt;(5)</code>. This disambiguates it from the comparison operators. But here still, a comparison expression inside the arguments list breaks it again: <code>my_func::&lt;3 &gt; 1&gt;</code>.
Luckily, Rust sidesteps this by banning expressions in template all-together, as allowing that itself would also introduce a whole lot of dependent types mess that <a href="https://hackmd.io/OZG_XiLFRs2Xmw5s39jRzA?view">turns pre-monomorphization into an undecidable problem</a>.</p>
<h3 id="verilog"><a class="header" href="#verilog">Verilog</a></h3>
<p>The Verilog solution is to simply move away from the angle bracket notation, and use a different one that doesn't conflict so heavily. In verilog's case, that's the <code>#(.varA(x), .varB(y), ...)</code> notation. The advantage here is explicitness, which is important in HW design, since otherwise you'd be instantiating modules like <code>FIFO #(32, 6, 2)</code> and you wouldn't know what the numbers mean.</p>
<p>This is not the only way to use templates in Verilog though, but in my opinion the <code>defparam</code> syntax is so verbose I'll leave it out of consideration.</p>
<h3 id="sus"><a class="header" href="#sus">SUS</a></h3>
<p>In Hardware Design, as opposed to software design, the vast majority of template instantiations do not depend on types, but rather on values. While software is full of things like <code>Result&lt;Vec&lt;i32&gt;, ErrorObject&gt;</code>, in hardware the sizes and parameters are numbers.
The typical example is instantiating a library Memory block: <code>Memory #(int DATA_WIDTH, int DEPTH, bool USE_OUTPUT_PIPELINE_STAGE, bool READ_PIPELINE_STAGE, etc)</code>. Using an unambiguous syntax may just be the solution here.
And yes, while Verilog's solution may not be familiar to software programmers, hardware designers are used to it.</p>
<p>I will, however, make one change to Verilog's notation. Taking inspiration from Rust, and in accordance with Hardware programmers' desire for explicitness, I'll change the template instantiation syntax to use named arguments with short form syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sus">module FIFO#(T, int SIZE, int LATENCY) {...}

module use_FIFO {
  gen int LATENCY = 3
  FIFO#(SIZE: 32, LATENCY, type T: int[3]) myFIFO

  myFIFO.push(...)
}
</code></pre>
<p>So in this example, <code>SIZE</code> is set to the result of the expression <code>32</code>, <code>LATENCY</code> happens to be named identically to the variable we assign to it, thus Rust's short form. And the type we pass in requires a special <code>type</code> keyword so the parser can distinguish it. Perhaps that could still be changed, since grammatically types appear to be a proper subset of expressions, but it also seems dangerous from an IDE perspective, as now it's not clear from the parse tree what it's supposed to be. Regardless, in many of those cases, types are easier to infer than values so the <code>type</code> fallback syntax should be a rare occurence.</p>

<p>Most of the time, Latency Counting is dependent on Template Instantiation. For example, a larger Memory may incur more latency overhead for reads and writes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one could want a measured latency count to be usable at compile time, to generate hardware that can specifically deal with this latency. For example, a FIFO's almostFull threshold.</p>
<p>Another important case: Automatic Generation of compact latency using BRAM shift registers. The compiler could instantiate a user-provided module with as template argument the latency between the bridging wires, but the module may then add vary in its latency depending on the memory block size, requiring the compiler to again fiddle with the template argument.</p>
<h3 id="solutions-2"><a class="header" href="#solutions-2">Solutions</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Always compile in order Template Instantiation -&gt; Flow Analysis &amp; Latency Counting. Explicitly state template args. Add asserts for latencies that are too high and reject designs that violate this.</li>
<li>For each nested module separately, perform Template Instantiation &amp; Latency Counting first, and allow use of measured latency of higher modules</li>
<li>Add latency template arguments, allowing higher modules to set the latency of lower modules. Reject lower modules that violate this latency.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="product-types"><a class="header" href="#product-types">Product Types</a></h1>
<p>Product types or structs are quite natural to express in hardware and should be supported by the language. A product type is represented as a bundle of the field data lines that together form the whole struct.</p>
<h1 id="sum-types"><a class="header" href="#sum-types">Sum Types</a></h1>
<p>Sum types, are the natural companion of Product Types. Though they are far less commonly supported in Software Languages, they have been gaining ground in recent years due to the popularity of the Rust Language. For software compilers, their implementation is quite natural. Since we only ever use one variant of a sum type at a time, we can share the memory that each of them would take up. This has many benefits: reduced struct size, possibility for shared field access optimization, and no real downsides.</p>
<p>The same however, cannot be said for hardware design. In hardware design, there are two main ways one could implement a sum type. Either sharing the wires for the variants, or having each variant have their own separate set. Which implemenation is most efficient depends on how the sum type is used. In the case of sharing the wires, we incur the cost of the multiplexers to put the signals on the same wire, as well as the additional routing and timing cross dependencies it introduces between the variants. On the other hand, in the case of separating out the variants into their own wires does not incur this cost, but storing and moving the sum type around takes far more wires and registers.</p>
<p>No natural implementation choice exists for Sum Types, and thus they shouldn't be supported at the language level.</p>
<p>One exception however, is quite natural in hardware, and that is the Maybe (or Option) type. Sum types in general actually fit nicely with the flow descriptors system, where the developer can specify which level of wire sharing they want, and which ports should describe separate variants.</p>
<p>Finally, there should be a type-safe implementation for a full wire-sharing sum type. That should be supported by the standard library, using something like a Union type, for those cases where the reduction in bus width is worth the additional multiplexers and routing constraints.</p>
<h1 id="enums"><a class="header" href="#enums">Enums</a></h1>
<p>Enums are lovely. It's important that the programmer can specify what the exact representation is, such that the compiler can optimize their use. Be it as a one-hot vector, binary encoding, or a combination of the two.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="core-philosophy"><a class="header" href="#core-philosophy">Core Philosophy</a></h1>
<p>SUS is meant to be a direct competitor to Synthesizeable Verilog and VHDL. Its main goal is to be an intuitive and thin syntax for building netlists, such that traditional synthesis tools can still be used to analyze the resulting hardware. SUS shall impose no paradigm on the hardware designer, such as requiring specific communication protocols or iteration constructs. In other words, SUS is not there to abstract away complexity, but rather to make the inherent complexity of hardware design more manageable.</p>
<p>The one restriction SUS does impose over Verilog and VHDL is that it requires the hardware to be <em>synchronous</em> over one or more clocks. Asynchronous hardware is therefore <em>unrepresentable</em> making SUS less suitable for ASIC development.</p>
<p>There are three main features that set SUS apart from the rest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generative Variables and Types can be freely combined. Any "Dependent Types" headaches that are caused by this are sidestepped by doing the main type checking after instantiation.</li>
<li>Easy Pipelining through an orthogonal language construct called "Latency Counting". 'Orthogonal' means that adding pipeline registers does not interfere with other language features such as generative or conditional code.</li>
<li>Separation of pipelines with interfaces. This keeps the user from accidentally crossing signals that have no logical relationship. At this level Clock Domain Crossings are implemented.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, an important consideration of SUS is the user interface. SUS comes with a VSCode IDE plugin that allows the copiler to be used fully in-IDE. Compiling, typechecking and instantiation is done as the user writes code, leading to a very tight development feedback loop.</p>

<div class="footnote-definition" id="timing"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Some timing constraints affect the cycle-by-cycle functioning of the design, such as the relative speeds of synchronous clocks and False/Multi-Cycle Path constraints. Because they affect the cycle-wise behaviour of the design, they should be provided as part of the language and incorporated in simulation. Of course, timing constraints like real clock speeds, edge patterns and external component timings still rightfully belong in the Timing Constraints file. It should not be possible to express SUS code that behaves differently between Simulation and Synthesis.</p>

<p>Of course, while the language does not support such protocols directly in the syntax, as this would put unneccesary extra constraints on the output hardware, modules for handling them will be provided in the standard library.</p>

<p>For this feature to be useable you really must use the LSP. The semantic analysis of the compiler gives important visual feedback while programming that makes this much easier to understand.</p>
<p>In this example, we create a memory block with a read port and a write port. This module has two domains: The read interface domain and write interface domain. Every wire in the design is part of one of these domains (or an anonymous domain if it's not connected to either interface).
