# What SUS does not do
- Provide abstractions for handshake protocols (Like AXI)
- Runtime Iteration Constructs
- Automatic Pipelining & Retiming

Of course, while the language does not support such protocols directly in the syntax, as this would put unneccesary extra constraints on the output hardware, modules for handling them will be provided in the standard library.
