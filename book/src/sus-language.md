# Introduction to the SUS Hardware Design Language

SUS (Synchronous Ultra-Structured) is a new language for hardware design (RTL) similar to Verilog and VHDL, but it focuses on simplifying the development of high-performance FPGA accelerators. Unlike other hardware description languages, SUS does not attempt to hide complexity; instead, it provides a clearer way to manage it.


# What is the main purpose of SUS ?
The main purpose of SUS is that, as the programmer, you are in the driver's seat. This means you're responsible for designing the hardware and ensuring every component is built to your specifications. While this places the responsibility on you, it also gives you immense power to ensure the hardware functions and is built exactly as you intend.
